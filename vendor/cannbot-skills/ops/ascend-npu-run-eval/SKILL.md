name: ascend-npu-run-eval
description: Execute and evaluate generated operator artifacts. Use when you need to run generated test cases, run generated benchmark cases, fast-screen a candidate operator against a baseline, profile benchmark harnesses, summarize profiling data, or compare performance artifacts, including during optimization workflows.

# Run-Eval Router

Use the bundled helper script in this skill. Treat
`<ascend-npu-run-eval-skill-path>` as the staged path to the
`ascend-npu-run-eval` skill for the active backend:

```bash
python3 <ascend-npu-run-eval-skill-path>/scripts/cli.py <subcommand> ...
```

For `probe-bench`, use the surface that actually exposes that subcommand in the current workspace. If the staged `cli.py` in this skill has not been updated yet, use the workspace's public `triton-agent probe-bench` command instead of guessing helper internals.

Read only the focused guide for the subcommand you are about to run:

- `run-test-baseline` / `run-test-optimize`: [references/run-test.md](references/run-test.md)
- `run-bench`: [references/run-bench.md](references/run-bench.md)
- `probe-bench`: [references/probe-bench.md](references/probe-bench.md)
- `profile-bench`: [references/profile-bench.md](references/profile-bench.md)
- `profile-report`: [references/profile-report.md](references/profile-report.md)
- `compare-perf`: [references/compare-perf.md](references/compare-perf.md)

During normal use:

- call `python3 <ascend-npu-run-eval-skill-path>/scripts/cli.py <subcommand> ...` directly
- do not read unrelated command guides
- do not reread Python files under `<ascend-npu-run-eval-skill-path>/scripts/` unless you need to debug, patch, or verify helper behavior
